# CCSDS 123.0-B-2 Hardware Implementation

This repository contains source codes for a hardware implementation of hyperspectral image compression compatible with the CCSDS 123.0-B-2 standard.
 
This work is part of research projects that I have participated as a student of the Computer Engineering degree and conclusion work of my graduation. The objective was to implement a hardware accelerator for the compression of hyperspectral images for use in space systems.
